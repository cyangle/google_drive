  # unit tests for drive_permissions_create
  # Creates a permission for a file or shared drive.
  # @param file_id The ID of the file or shared drive.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :alt Data format for the response.
  # @option opts [String] :fields Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
  # @option opts [String] :key API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
  # @option opts [String] :oauth_token OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
  # @option opts [Bool] :pretty_print Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
  # @option opts [String] :quota_user An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
  # @option opts [String] :user_ip Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.
  # @option opts [String] :email_message A plain text custom message to include in the notification email.
  # @option opts [Bool] :enforce_single_parent Deprecated. See moveToNewOwnersRoot for details.
  # @option opts [Bool] :move_to_new_owners_root This parameter will only take effect if the item is not in a shared drive and the request is attempting to transfer the ownership of the item. If set to true, the item will be moved to the new owner&#39;s My Drive root folder and all prior parents removed. If set to false, parents are not changed.
  # @option opts [Bool] :send_notification_email Whether to send a notification email when sharing to users or groups. This defaults to true for users and groups, and is not allowed for other requests. It must not be disabled for ownership transfers.
  # @option opts [Bool] :supports_all_drives Whether the requesting application supports both My Drives and shared drives.
  # @option opts [Bool] :supports_team_drives Deprecated use supportsAllDrives instead.
  # @option opts [Bool] :transfer_ownership Whether to transfer ownership to the specified user and downgrade the current owner to a writer. This parameter is required as an acknowledgement of the side effect. File owners can only transfer ownership of files existing on My Drive. Files existing in a shared drive are owned by the organization that owns that shared drive. Ownership transfers are not supported for files and folders in shared drives. Organizers of a shared drive can move items from that shared drive into their My Drive which transfers the ownership to them.
  # @option opts [Bool] :use_domain_admin_access Issue the request as a domain administrator; if set to true, then the requester will be granted access if the file ID parameter refers to a shared drive and the requester is an administrator of the domain to which the shared drive belongs.
